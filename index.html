				<ul>
					<li> The game is divided in three different rows, first player area, void and second player area </li>
					<li> The goal is to clear your area from all the cards </li>
					<li> Each player gets his turn to press a number which then is distributed one each on the following columsn in anti-clockwise order </li>
					<li> The cards get distributed to opponent's area once enough number is clicked but ne point is lost every time the numbers have to pass through the ring </li>
					<li> The game has lot of area for thinking and stratigizing </li>
					<li> Happy Gaming :D  </li>
